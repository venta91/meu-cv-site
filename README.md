# João Ventania — Product Manager & Digital Builder

👋 Welcome to the source code of my personal website — a modern, responsive and multilingual CV built using no traditional designer or developer help. This project was created entirely through tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), [Lovable](https://lovable.so), and automated platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## 📌 About This Project

This project explores a key idea:

> **Anyone with a solid product mindset and basic development principles can build digital solutions independently.**

I wanted to demonstrate that:
- It's possible to build a professional-grade personal site without writing code from scratch or designing from zero.
- Tools like GPT, low-code platforms, and collaborative AI agents can radically reduce the friction in shipping great ideas.
- This is just the beginning — of a new way to create.

It includes:

- ✅ Custom sections for About, Experience, Projects, Skills, and Contact.
- 🌍 Language switch (PT / EN / ES).
- 💡 Article recommendations connected to [Medium](https://medium.com/) and [Substack](https://substack.com/).
- 📩 Functional contact form (via Resend or Formspree).
- ⚡ Optimized performance (lazy loading, minimal JS/CSS footprint).
- 🔍 SEO best practices & Open Graph metadata.
